## Features

- **Document Parsing**: Automatically parses content from various document formats (PDF, CSV, DOCX, PPTX).
- **LLM-powered Q&A Extraction**: Utilizes Litellm to interact with different LLMs (e.g., gemini/gemini-2.5-flash) to extract question-answer pairs and the AI's thought process.
- **Flexible Output**: Exports extracted Q&A into `JSONL`, `CSV`, or `Parquet` formats.
- **Batch Processing**: Processes single files or entire directories of documents.
- **Hugging Face Hub Integration**: Easily push your extracted datasets to the Hugging Face Hub.

## Installation

Install the package from PyPI:

```bash
pip install DAmon
```

## Configuration

This tool uses `litellm` to interact with various LLM providers. You'll need to set up your API keys and specify the model.

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your Litellm model and API key. For example, if you are using OpenAI:

```dotenv
GEMINI_API_KEY=<gemini-api-key>
```

Refer to the [Litellm documentation](https://litellm.ai/docs/providers) for details on configuring different LLM providers and their respective environment variables.

### Custom Prompt Template

You can customize the LLM's prompt template. The `damon` command will look for a file named `DAMON_PROMPT.md` in the directory where it is executed.

- If `DAMON_PROMPT.md` exists, its content will be used as the `PROMPT_TEMPLATE`.
- If `DAMON_PROMPT.md` does not exist, the default prompt template embedded in `DAmon/core.py` will be used.

A template file, `DAMON_PROMPT_template.md`, has been provided in the project root. You can copy and rename this file to `DAMON_PROMPT.md` to start customizing your prompt.

## Usage

The main command-line interface is `damon`.

### Processing Documents

Use the `process` command to process documents and extract Q&A pairs.

```bash
damon process <INPUT_PATH> [OPTIONS]
```

-   `<INPUT_PATH>`: Path to the input document (file or directory).

**Options:**

-   `--input-format [pdf|csv|docx|pptx|auto]`: Format of the input document(s). Use `"auto"` to detect based on file extension. Default: `auto`.
-   `--model TEXT`: Litellm model name to use for Q&A extraction. 
-   `--output-path PATH`: Path to save the extracted Q&A. Can be a file or a directory. If a directory, a timestamped file will be created. Default: `results/output.jsonl`.
-   `--export-format [jsonl|csv|parquet]`: Format for exporting the extracted Q&A. Default: `jsonl`.
-   `--num-qa INTEGER`: Number of Q&A pairs to extract per document. If not specified, extracts as many as possible.

**Examples:**

1.  **Process a single PDF file, output to CSV:**

    ```bash
    damon process --input data/test.pdf --model gemini/gemini-2.5-flash --output results/cyber_output --export csv --num-qa 5
    ```

2.  **Process all documents in a directory, auto-detect format, output to JSONL:**

    ```bash
    damon process data/ --input-format auto --output-path results/ --export-format jsonl
    ```

3.  **Process a specific number of Q&A pairs from a DOCX file:**

    ```bash
    damon process documents/report.docx --input-format docx --num-qa 5 --output-path results/report_qa.jsonl
    ```

### Pushing to Hugging Face Hub

Use the `push-to-hf` command to upload your extracted dataset files to the Hugging Face Hub.

```bash
damon push-to-hf --input-file <FILE_PATH> --repo-id <REPO_ID> [--split <SPLIT_NAME>]
```

-   `--input-file <FILE_PATH>`: Path to the data file to push (e.g., `results/output.jsonl`).
-   `--repo-id <REPO_ID>`: Hugging Face Hub repository ID (e.g., `your-username/your-dataset-repo`).
-   `--split <SPLIT_NAME>`: Optional. The name of the dataset split (e.g., `train`, `validation`, `test`). Defaults to `train`.

**Prerequisites for pushing:**

-   You need to have the `datasets` and `huggingface_hub` libraries installed (`pip install datasets huggingface_hub`).
-   You must be logged in to Hugging Face. Run `huggingface-cli login` in your terminal and follow the prompts.

**Example:**

```bash
damon push-to-hf --input-file results/output_20250630_140154.csv --repo-id your-username/my-extracted-qa-dataset --split train
```
